<p class="s">Comprehensive management of angina and stable CHD entails multiple therapeutic approaches, including the following:<br><br>* Identification and treatment of associated diseases that can precipitate or worsen angina and ischemia;<br>
    * Cardiac risk factor identification and intervention;<br>
   * Application of pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions for secondary prevention;<br>
   * Pharmacological and symptomatic management of angina and ischemia; and<br>
   * Myocardial revascularization with PCI or CABG surgery, when indicated<br><br>A multidimensional management approach integrates all of these considerations, often simultaneously, in each patient. Among pharmacotherapies, three drug classes have been demonstrated to reduce mortality and morbidity in patients with stable CHD and preserved left ventricular (LV) function: aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, and effective lipid lowering. Beta-blockers have been shown to reduce mortal ity in patients with prior MI (CAPRICORN Investigators, 2001). Other therapies such as nitrates, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and ranolazine have been shown to improve angina and exercise performance and to reduce ischemia, but have not been proven to reduce mortality in patients with stable CHD.<br><br>Clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of chronic stable angina (Fraker et al., 2007; Gibbons et al., 2002a), unstable angina/non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (Anderson et al., 2007), and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (Antman et al., 2004; Kushner et al., 2009), have been jointly published by AHA and the American College of Cardiology (ACC). These guidelines detail the indications and timing of medical therapy (including lifestyle modification) and revascularization with PCI and/or CABG (Eagle et al., 2004) and provide guidance for secondary prevention that includes risk factor reduction (Smith et al., 2006). Although revascularization has specific indications, treatment with medical therapy, lifestyle modification, and risk factor reduction is recommended across the spectrum of CHD in both stable and unstable patients and following a coronary event or revascularization.<br><br>
   <h1>Ischemic Heart Disease in Children</h1><br><br>Ischemic heart disease in children is often due to structural anomalies of the proximal coronary arteries, coronary fistulae, Kawasaki disease, or injury to the coronary arteries during cardiac surgery. Ischemia may be evaluated using stress or resting echocardiography, radionuclide perfusion studies, or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, but two abnormalities in two territories are not necessary for diagnosis of ischemia in children. Treatment of ischemia may involve surgical or cardiac interventional approaches.<br><br>

  <p class="s"><h1>Recent Advances</h1><br><br>The most recent advance in medical therapy consists of the introduction of ranolazine (Chaitman, 2006; Chaitman et al., 2004; Morrow et al., 2007). Nonpharmacologic treatments include spinal cord stimulation (Taylor et al., 2009) and enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) (Akhtar et al., 2006; Michaels et al., 2004; Soran et al., 2006) for the treatment of angina and ischemia. Advances in revascularization include development of drug-eluting stents (Novack et al., 2009), the introduction of percutaneous support devices in patients undergoing PCI (Goldstein et al., 1998), and increased use of off-pump techniques, as well as minimal access and robotic procedures in patients undergoing CABG (Poston et al., 2008; Sabik et al., 2002). Interest and experience also have been growing in the performance of hybrid revascularization procedures (Stahl et al., 2002) using a collaborative approach between interventional cardiologists and cardiothoracic surgeons.<br><br>EECP is an alternative treatment for patients with refractory angina. It is generally administered as 35 sequential treatments (1 hour daily; 5 days per week) over 7 weeks. EECP was shown to increase the time to ST-segment depression during exercise testing, reduce angina, and improve health-related quality of life for at least 1 year in a randomized, double-blind study of patients with chronic stable angina (Soran et al., 2006). EECP does not reduce ischemia on myocardial perfusion imaging, and the mechanisms underlying its effects are poorly understood.<br><br><h1>Side Effects of Treatments</h1><br><br>Nitroglycerin and nitrates can cause vasodilation-induced headache, a decrease in blood pressure, and, more rarely, severe hypotension with bradycardia. The vasodilation by nitroglycerin may be markedly exaggerated and prolonged in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitors sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra), and tadalafil (Cialis), so these agents should not be used concurrently with nitrates.<br><br>

Most of the adverse effects of beta-blockers occur as a consequence of the known properties of these drugs and include cardiac effects (e.g., severe sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest, reduced LV contractility), bronchoconstriction, fatigue, mental depression, nightmares, gastrointestinal upset, sexual dysfunction, intensification of insulin-induced hypoglycemia, and cutaneous reactions. Lethargy, weakness, and fatigue may be caused by reduced cardiac output or may arise from a direct effect on the central nervous system. Bronchoconstriction results from blockade of beta2 receptors in the tracheobronchial tree. As a consequence, reversible obstructive lung disease (e.g., asthma) may be considered as relative contraindications to beta-blockers, even to beta1-selective agents (Egred et al., 2005).<br><br>

Calcium channel blockers are potent vasodilators, which may lead to dizziness, hypotension, and reflex tachycardiaâ€”particularly with some dihydropyridines. Peripheral edema can occur, usually with the dihydropyri dines. Both verapamil and diltiazem can cause bradycardia or conduction disturbances, particularly if coadministered with beta-blockers. Diltiazem and verapamil may exacerbate or precipitate heart failure in patients with reduced LV ejection fraction.<br><br>
