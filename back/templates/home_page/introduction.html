<p class="s">**Coronary heart disease and coronary artery disease are more common names for ischemic disease. According to the Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ischemic heart disease is the most common form of heart disease in the United States. It is also the leading cause of heart attack.<br><br>**This disease most often occurs when cholesterol particles in the blood build up on the walls of the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle. Eventually, deposits called plaques may form. These plaques are a result of inflammation.<br><br>**These deposits cause the arteries to narrow. This narrowing can block the flow of blood. This reduces the amount of oxygenated blood reaching the heart muscle. This process is called atherosclerosis .If you have ischemic heart disease, you may have chest pain or discomfort during exertion or excitement. These are times when the heart requires greater blood flow. “Angina” is the name for this type of chest pain.<br><br>**The signs and symptoms of this disease may develop slowly as plaques gradually block the arteries. However, sometimes the symptoms arise quickly if an artery suddenly becomes blocked. Some people with ischemic heart disease have no symptoms at all. This is called “silent ischemia.” A heart attack can be the first sign of a problem for someone who has silent ischemia. Other people may first have severe chest pain and shortness of breath. <br><br>**The signs and symptoms of this disease may develop slowly as plaques gradually block the arteries.

Seek immediate medical care (call 911) for serious symptoms, such as severe chest pain, difficulty breathing, dizziness, fainting, pale or blue lips, or rapid heart rate. Seek prompt medical care if you are being treated for angina but have symptoms that recur, worsen, or are persistent even at rest.
